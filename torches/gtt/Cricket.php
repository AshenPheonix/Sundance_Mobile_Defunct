            The mighty Cricket is a standard surface mix burner featuring 5 jets. It is an entry to intermediate torch, but even the skilled lamp worker will be surprised by the performance of the Cricket.

            The Cricket is capable of working both soft and borosilicate glass with ease. The Cricket can work 1" solid borosilicate. The Cricket can work up to a 2" borosilicate pendant and larger soft glass pieces. The flame characteristics of the Cricket make
            it a very efficient, clean burning torch that makes the most difficult colors easy to work and control. The penetrating heat of the flame make borosilicate beads and pendants easy without any change to the torch setup.

            This torch will be a great economical choice when setting up a studio with multiple torches. The Cricket was designed to get the best performance possible out of an economical 5 LPM 5 PSI oxygen concentrator. The Cricket is not limited to small concentrator
            use, it does extremely well on 10 LPM concentrators as well as using tanked oxygen. This means that it maximizes the output of smaller oxygen concentrators and is very efficient on tanked oxygen too! It can be run on 1/4 PSI fuel gas and 3
            PSI oxygen! The Cricket makes the most heat out of the available fuel and oxygen for an extremely clean flame with no carbon on the torch when run properly.
