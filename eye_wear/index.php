            Protective Eyewear for Glassworkers, Lampworkers, and Beadmakers

            We offer the highest quality filtered glass lenses designed for glass working. You no longer have to pay
            those high prices for frames from that other company. Most filtering lenses come from the same factory in
            Germany, so the only difference between
            where you buy your glasses is the style of the frame and how much you pay. We also sell many didymium
            glasses to Blacksmiths.

                        The Sodium Flare Polycarbonate lens is the sister lens to the 202ACE Glass Lenses. The Sodium
                        Flare
                        Polycarbonate lens is a very effective filter for sodium flare absorption in addition to

                        ultraviolet (UV) protection up to 390 mm.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The Sodium Flare lens is becoming a preferable choice of soft glass
                        workers in the industry due to its excellent absorption, light weight and durability.
                        Not only is it very comfortable for viewing under high ambient light conditions, but it also
                        allows a high
                        Visible Light Transmission permitting you to see in any lighting situation.

                        This filter has a recommended use of

                        Flare filtration
                        without IR protection. This lens has very little IR absorption. If you need IR absorption,

        </h3>
        <p>
            Green ACE IR are designed to meet the need for the extra UV and IR protection needed when working on
            borosilicate glass. Green ACE IR are specially formulated glass filter lenses that the manufacturer
            exclusively owns. These lenses have been developed for the lampworking and glassblowing markets. This
            revolutionary product is dramatically lighter than conventional laminated products and comes in a full
            coverage lens which is a higher quality design because there are no areas without shading. Green ACE IR
            should be worn when working on hard glass projects where regular didymium lenses are not adequate due
            to
            the fact of insufficient filtration of ultra violet and infrared absorption.
