        <h5>The Janus-24 glass/Pottery Kiln</h5>
        <p>
            The Paragon Janus-24 can fire both pottery and glass. Heating elements are mounted in the top, sidewalls, and door.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select between glass and pottery with the flip of a switch. With the switch in the glass position, heat comes from the top
            elements and the middle sidewall element. With the switch in the pottery position, heat comes from only the sidewall
            elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the glass mode, fuse and sag large glass projects placed on a single shelf. In the pottery mode, fire to cone 10. You
            can also fire several shelves of smaller glass pieces in pottery mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Janus-24 digital kiln heats from the top, three sides and door for unsurpassed heat distribution. Bend glass for curved
            windows or cabinet doors and to repair lampshades. Make huge glass-fused platters. Crack the door to drag a rod
            across the softened glass or to emboss designs in the surface. Explore small-to-medium sized casting and pâte
            de verre. Enjoy the glittering beauty of dichroics. Make treasured gifts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The elements in the roof are mounted in a firebrick "ball" groove that eliminates element pins. The element coils are wider
            than the groove opening, so the elements stay in place without pins. The groove dissipates heat efficiently
        </p>
        <p>
            Wires are fastened to the elements with heat-dissipating connectors refined and proven over many years in Paragon kilns.
            Elements are coiled from the finest high-temperature wire available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Will you anneal glass for long periods in your Janus-24? Then you should order the mercury relay upgrade. The mercury relays
            found on our large industrial kilns outlast mechanical relays. The life of the quiet, reliable mercury relay
            has been measured in millions of on/off cycles. Please call for a price on the mercury relay upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
            The insulating firebrick, wrapped in heavy-gauge steel, soak up heat for slow, efficient cooling. A double heat shield and
            air gap between the kiln and ventilated switch box help keep electrical components cool for long, trouble-free
            service. Costly heavy-gauge nickel-plated copper wiring is covered with high temperature glass-braided insulation.
            The thermocouple, which senses temperature inside the kiln, is protected with a high-nickel stainless steel sheath
            for long life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spring-pressure latch and a ½" recess around the edge of the firebrick door keep the door tightly closed. The door remains
            rock-steady on a heavy hinge shaft. Four hand lifts aid moving. The base is open in the back and slotted to dissipate
            heat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch the red-hot glass through two tapered peepholes, drilled one above the other in the wall opposite the switch box. Peephole
            plugs are included.
        </p>
        <p>
            The digital Sentry 2.0 includes two modes: Cone-Fire with programmed slow cooling and 18-Segment Ramp-Hold. Manufactured
            by the Orton Ceramic Foundation exclusively for Paragon.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be amazed at the convenience of digital firing. The reliable solid-state Sentry controller continually monitors
            the firing so you can spend your time productively without closely watching the kiln. (Please remember, however,
            to check the kiln during firing and to monitor it near the expected shutoff time.) The sealed touch pad keeps
            out dust and is easy to wipe clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragon's innovative controller will help you achieve consistent results from one firing to the next. The controller has
            powerful features that you will enjoy using. Yet we have also worked hard to make the controller user-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you ever wonder how much electricity your kiln uses? The digital controller can figure this for you with the press of
            a button. Find out how little a kiln actually costs to fire. Learn to conserve energy by experimenting with firing
            speed, load density, etc
        </p>
        <p>
            The Janus-24 has a durable high temperature, water-base finish. We chose water-base paint because of the low emissions during
            spraying. This creates a safer working environment for our employees and cuts down on pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, of course, the Janus-24 is proudly made in America by skilled workers. Many of them have been with Paragon for over
            a decade.
        </p>

            Martin Bush of Richardson, Texas owns a Janus-24. "What I like about it is the ability to fire ceramics, so I can make my
            own molds for slumping glass," said Martin. "I have noticed that in the glass mode, the kiln cannot handle fast
            temperature rates (500 degrees per hour or higher), usually when I do pot melts. No problem. I just use the ceramic
            mode, which easily handles the higher rates. The size is great for a variety of projects, from small to large.
            Now that I see where I can use the ceramic setting with multiple shelves on small projects, even better!"
