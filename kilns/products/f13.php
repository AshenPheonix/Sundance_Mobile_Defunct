<div class="row">

        <p>
            Why a Vertical-Drop Door? There is heat on the inside of a kiln door. Kilns with swing out doors expose you to the hot inside door. But this Vertical-Drop door swings up never exposing you to that hot door. A digital controller which includes a pyrometer
            is included with kiln. This bead kiln, made with insulated fire brick, can also be used for fusing glass, ceramics, copper enameling, or many different uses. All kilns should be kept 12&quot; from any flammable materials. The fiber cloth door covering
            pictured, is included free with the kiln.<br>

        <br> Ease of operation will delight you. Never before has lamp work been so easy in this price range. Imagine the massive, award-winning figurines you will be able to make with this kiln.<br>
        <br> The F-series lid elements use a new element groove that eliminates element pins. The element coils are wider than the groove opening, so the elements stay in place without pins. The element is mounted in the top of the kiln for safety. There
        is no sidewall element to touch with a punty rod. With the element in the top, you can also fuse and slump glass. <br>
        <br> Imagine the glass you could sag, slump, and fuse with this kiln. Make small bowls, pendants, earrings, cufflinks, and even bracelets. Enjoy the glittering beauty of Dichroics. This kiln will give you a haven of creative enjoyment that you
        will enjoy for many years.<br>
