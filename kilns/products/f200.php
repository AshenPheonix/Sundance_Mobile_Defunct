        <h4 class="left">Paragon F-200 Lamp Working Kiln
        </h4>
        <p class="left">
            <span class="bodyText">This is a true high performance kiln that you will enjoy using often. Anneal large glass figurines up to 6&#34;
                tall in the digital F-200 lamp working kiln. Raise the spring-loaded vertical-drop door to insert a glass
                figurine with a punty rod. Lower the door. The punty rod extends outside the firing chamber through the smaller
                punty rod door. This allows the glass to anneal safely. Maintain the annealing temperature indefinitely with
                the Sentry Xpress 3-key controller.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="left bodyText">The F-200 not only fires figurines but also safely anneals glass beads to prevent breakage during cooling. The 2&#34;
            tall, 11&#34; wide double doors give 22&#34; of width for inserting bead rods. This kiln is ideal for seminar
            teachers. It is like having two kilns instead of one.
        </p>
        <p class="left bodyText">With the element in the top, you can fuse and slump glass in this large, 25&#34; wide x 15&#34; deep versatile kiln.
            Enjoy even heat distribution for consistent firing results. The F-200 easily reaches fusing temperatures.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="left bodyText">The F-200 has durable insulating firebricks in the roof, walls and floor. The element is seated in pinless grooves
            in the roof. The element is mounted in the top of the kiln for safety. There is no sidewall element. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="left bodyText">The insulating firebrick, wrapped in heavy-gauge steel, soak up heat for slow, efficient cooling. Costly heavy-gauge
            nickel-plated copper wiring is covered with high temperature glass-braided insulation. The thermocouple, which
            senses temperature inside the kiln, is protected with a high-nickel stainless steel sheath for long life. No
            extra stand is needed; the built-in base stays cool even during extended hold times.
        </p>
        <p class="left bodyText">The F-200 has dual mechanical relays for extra reliability. They send power to the elements on command from the digital
            controller. Two relays last longer than the single relay of competitive kilns because of the reduced amperage
            going through the relays.
        </p>
        <p class="left bodyText">In addition, you can order the mercury relay upgrade with your new kiln. The mercury relays found on our large industrial
            kilns outlast mechanical relays. The life of the quiet, reliable mercury relay has been measured in millions
            of on/off cycles.

            The F-200 has a user-friendly 3-key Sentry Xpress 3-key controller which includes two firing modes: Single Speed and 8-segment
            Ramp-Hold. The solid-state controller continually monitors the firing so you can spend your time productively
            without closely watching the kiln. The sealed controller touch pad keeps out dust and is easy to wipe clean.

                We chose water-base paint because of the low emissions during spraying. This creates a safer working environment
                for our employees and cuts down on pollution.</span>
