        <p>Often times you may want to move your kiln to clean under it or just get it out of the way when it is not being used. Think how nice it would be to get that car in the garage every once in a while.</p>
        <p> These stands are constructed of heavy duty square tubing and are equipped with high quality locking steel castors that won’t develop flat spots if they sit too long unlike plastic or rubber wheels. They also have a convenient, built
            in, expanded metal tray that will catch falling glass and provides a place for your tools. Finally, they provide  the recommended clearances from the kiln to the floor.</p>
