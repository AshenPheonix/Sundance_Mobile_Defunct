            You will never outgrow a small kiln. If you later buy a larger kiln, continue to use the small one for testing or small projects. Perfect a new design in the small kiln before running production quantities in the large kiln. A small test kiln is invaluable in solving ceramic glaze problems and perfecting difficult glazes such as crystalline.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heat of the kiln is magical and offers wonderful surprises. Stained glass, enamels, and ceramic glazes undergo a complete transformation in the kiln. Opening a kiln to view your treasures is a festive moment that you will never outgrow. Artists have said, “Wahoo! Opening a kiln is a celebration!”
        </p>
        <p>
            The firing results will thrill you. Create breathtaking glass bracelets and pendants in the 8" square x 4 1/2" high interior. Fire small glass casting molds and even drop molds. But you are not limited to glass. Fire porcelain or stoneware pendants and beads. Test glazes. The kiln has plenty of power to reach 2350 degrees° F.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Paragon FireFly is an excellent choice for beginners. It fires rapidly. Yet you can slow it down with the infinite control switch. The pilot light glows brightly during firing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy digital accuracy on a modest budget: Watch the kiln temperature on the hand-held, easy-to-read digital pyrometer, which is included at no extra charge. The pyrometer will help you determine the cooling rate of difficult glazes or know when to begin monitoring glass. It takes the guesswork out of firing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reliable hand-held pyrometer weighs only 5 ounces and measures in degrees °F up to 1999°F. (Please note: If you fire hotter than 1999°F, you will need a pyrometer that reads higher temperatures.) The liquid crystal display is easy to read even in bright daylight. Replace the Type-K thermocouple in seconds with a simple plug-in connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Paragon FireFly is made of durable 2 ½" thick insulating firebrick, which stores heat for slow cooling and safe annealing of smaller glass projects. The solid 2 ½" thick firebrick top and bottom help seal in the heat.        
        </p>
        <p>
            To strengthen the firing chamber, the firebrick corners are fitted together with L-shaped notches. This type of joint lasts longer than the butted joint and the “picture frame” mitered joint found on competitive brands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropped, recessed grooves protect the replaceable heating elements for longer life. Wires are fastened to the elements with heat-dissipating connectors refined and proven over many years in Paragon kilns. Rugged construction makes this kiln a little workhorse.
        </p>
        <p>
            This kiln is built to last. Elements are coiled from the finest high-temperature wire available. They use heat-dissipating element connectors refined and proven over many years in Paragon kilns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hinged lid is self-adjusting to compensate for expansion at high temperatures. The hinge includes a stop that holds the lid open and out of the way. Lift the lid with a handle on the front or a separate handle on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
            A built-in 3" tall steel base with mar-proof rubber feet covers the entire firebrick bottom. Place the kiln directly onto a heat-resistant work surface. No extra stand is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
        A stainless steel heat shield inside the switch box protects wiring from contact with the case. Costly nickel-plated copper wiring is covered with high temperature glass-braided insulation. Louvers on the top, side, and bottom of the switch box circulate air for the long life of the electrical components while keeping dust inside the box to a minimum.
