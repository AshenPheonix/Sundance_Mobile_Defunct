                Solid State Relays are just what the name implies…they are SOLID. When you have a $200 crucible filled with $1000 worth of glass, the last thing you want in the world is to have a relay go out. Over our 50 years we have tested a lot of relays and solid state relays when engineered with a properly sized heat sink are some of the best.

                    The GM818-3CR comes standard with APM elements. For people who are using material that does not out-gas too many caustic fumes (like batch or many colors) these elements should give you significantly longer life. They have a different cell structure from standard A-1 element wire which is more dimensionally stable at higher temperatures.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Most all of the kilns that leave are factory are equipped with a Type K thermocouple. Type K thermocouples are accurate and inexpensive. The downside to Type K thermocouples is that they wear out, and they wear out faster when exposed to extreme conditions. Type S thermocouples can virtually last forever. The reason for this is that they are made of platinum which does not degrade under most atmospheres and has an extremely high melting point. This leads us to one of their downsides, they are expensive…BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OF PLATINUM!!!
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    They are mostly used in scientific settings where they are constantly exposed to harsh environments like that of a crucible kiln. Because it is made of very expensive Platinum, the wire used to construct the thermocouple is very, very thin. On top of this, it is housed in a fragile high alumina cover. If you hit it with a crucible, it’s game over, so be careful.

                    Skutt is one of the few brands that installs Current Sensors, and they're in every KilnMaster Kiln. This allows you to read the Amperage of each section of the kiln as well as the Voltage and Voltage Under Load
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Now with the touch of a few buttons you can give those readings over the phone to your kiln repair technician so they can troubleshoot the problem and make sure they have the correct parts when they come out for the repair. This Saves Time and Money.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Prior to the use of these current sensors someone would have to come to your house and test the amperage and voltage inside the control box with live wires exposed. This system is Much Safer.

                    The Mantis Door System was designed for ease of use and ease of maintenance. The top hat door rocks back on an arc, keeping the hot face of the lid facing down so it does not radiate heat back at you while you are dipping. It has a wood handle that stays cool so you will not burn yourself. The main lid is hinged seperately and is cut with an 8″ access hole. To load or remove a crucible simply release a chain that allows the Mantis frame to move out of the way and open the lid.

                <p class="card-text">
                    When glass is molten it is conductive. When the top hat is opened, a shut-off switch is activated so you will not shock yourself while dipping.
