            <p> Paragon digital kilns are powered by either the 12-key Sentry micro processor or the smaller 3-key Sentry Xpress. These micro processors are the result of intensive effort between Paragon Industries, L.P. and Orton Ceramic Foundation. The
                controllers add convenience and accuracy to your firings.</p>
            <p> Owning a Sentry is like hiring an assistant to watch your kiln. Nevertheless, please remember that you should monitor the kiln occasionally during firing, especially near the expected shut-off. (We do not warrant against over-fires.)  </p>
            <p> Sentry 12-Key 2.0  </p>
            <p> Most Paragon ceramic kilns use the Sentry 12-key. Some of its exciting features:  </p>

        <div class="col-12 text-left">
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Temperature Display</strong> throughout firing and cooling in your choice of °F or °C  </li>
                <li> <strong>Firing Cost</strong> Enter the cost of electricity and kiln amperage in Options. After the kiln fires to completion, press the 8 key for the cost of electricity to fire that load.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Rate </strong>At the factory, we can configure a controller for you to show rate as degrees of temperature change per hour (the default), degrees of temperature change per minute, or elapsed time needed to reach a temperature.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Stop/Back Key</strong> goes back one step with each key press during programming. Use this feature to correct programming errors.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Add Time Key</strong> adds five minutes to a temperature hold with each key press during firing. Helpful for glass with holds.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Program Review</strong> lets you check that the program you are about to fire is correct.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Audible Temperature Alarm</strong> to remind yourself to close a vented lid or to check the kiln near firing completion.  </li>
                <li> <strong>30 Month Warranty</strong>  </li>
                <li> <strong>Thermocouple Selection</strong> The Sentry 2.0 can operate types K, S or R thermocouples.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Error Messages</strong> report mechanical problems such as a disconnected thermocouple, bad voltage, temperature deviation.  </li>
                <li> <strong>14 Segment Display</strong> is easier to read than the previous 7 segment.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Program Safety Lock</strong> for the program in active memory. Gives you peace of mind.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Delay Fire</strong> Set the time that the firing is to start. The kiln will turn on at that time.  </li>
                <li> <strong>LED Lights</strong> show when the relays are powered.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Quick Release Molex Connectors</strong> permit fast removal of the controller. Replacing the Sentry 2.0 or Sentry Xpress takes only minutes.  </li>

            <p> The Sentry 2.0 can be installed on all existing Paragon 12-key digital kilns. It uses the same size faceplate as the earlier DTC 100 - 1000 series. Upgrade a switch-operated kiln with the wall-mount version.  </p>
            <p class="bold large"> Thermocouples </p>
            <p> The thermocouple senses temperature inside the kiln. The standard thermocouple on most Paragon kilns equipped with the Sentry 2.0 is the ¼” Type-K. It is hermetically sealed in a metal sheath for long life. It replaces the earlier 1/8” thermocouple.
            </p>
            <p> Though a precision instrument, the thermocouple wears with use, resulting in a gradual shift in temperature readout. (This wear occurs mostly above 2000°F.) If you fire pottery, consider the deluxe Type-S, noted for its extreme longevity.
            </p>
            <p> Ramp-Hold Custom Programming  </p>
            <p> Ramp-Hold allows you to infinitely adjust each part of the firing cycle. Vary the firing to obtain different effects from the same glaze.  </p>
            <p> Ramp-Hold programs are made of segments. Each segment has a temperature, firing rate, and, if desired, a temperature hold.  </p>

                <li> <strong>Store Nine Programs:</strong> One 18-segment and eight 10-segment programs remain in memory even when the kiln is unplugged.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Present Status</strong> shows which segment the kiln has reached during firing.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Cooling </strong>Control both heating and cooling. For deeper colors, especially iron reds, experiment with slow cooling.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Hold</strong> is available in every segment.  </li>
