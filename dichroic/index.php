        What is dichroic glass? A popular eye-catcher of the glass art industry, dichroic glass is produced by specially treating one side of a glass sheet or rod with a thin layer of metallic oxides. The result is a prism-like effect where the glass appears to be different colors from different angles and takes on a vibrant iridescent sheen like that of the inner surface of abalone shells, reflective butterfly wings, and some stones like moonstone. Dichroic glass is produced in a wonderful variety of colors, patterns, and great textures! It can be found on glass with different COE's for a variety of uses from jewelry, beads, sculptures, to fused pieces, vases, ornaments, and more. Dichoric glass is a must for making any glass art piece shine!
