            The Bobcat was the first creation of GTT, now redesigned for more versatile flame characteristics. The Bobcat is a standard surface mix torch with 7 jets. The Bobcat is capable of flame sizes from a 2" long pinpoint flame for detail work and finite heating
            to a 9/16" diameter, 13" long flame for 1.5" solid borosilicate glasswork . The Bobcat can work up to 3" borosilicate pendants. It is great for making beads, marbles and sculptures in soft or hard glass.
        </p>

            The flame characteristics of the Bobcat make it a very efficient, clean burning torch that makes the most difficult colors and effects easy to work and control. The penetrating heat of the flame make borosilicate beads and pendants easy without any change
            to the torch setup.
        </p>

            The Bobcat runs very well on 5 LPM 5 PSI concentrators with optimal performance on an 8 LPM concentrator. Fuel pressures can be run as low as 1/4 PSI on Natural gas or Propane. The Bobcat makes the most heat out of the available fuel and oxygen for an
            extremely clean flame with no carbon on the torch when run properly. The Bobcat is not limited to small concentrator use, it does extremely well on 10 LPM concentrators as well as using tanked oxygen. This means that it maximizes the output
            of smaller oxygen concentrators and is very efficient on tanked oxygen too!
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bobcat comes standard with barb fittings and in-line filter screens to easily slide on 1/4” ID grade “T” hoses and clamp securely. The stainless steel base has 4 holes for securing the torch to the work table, and can be used as a forming and shaping
            tool for hot glass pieces. Also included are complete instructions and cleaning wires.

            Surface mix tips work with all kinds of glass, soft and hard. This torch is a surface mix torch. Pre-Mix tips only work with borosilicate hard glass (Pyrex) but are faster working.
