        <blockquote class="text-justify">
            "I just want you to know how much fun my husband is having making glass beads, using your Kit #3! We just got it about a month ago, and it is wonderful. He just got his first order for some beaded jewelry! He has taken to it like a fish to water. Thank you for providing such a wonderful kit that has really helped him get started and will take him so much further."
