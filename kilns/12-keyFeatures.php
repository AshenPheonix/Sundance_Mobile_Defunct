            Paragon Sentry 12-key 2.0
        </h1>
        <p class="text-left mt-3">
            Paragon digital kilns are powered by either the 12-key Sentry micro processor or the smaller 3-key Sentry
            Xpress. These micro processors are the result of intensive effort between Paragon Industries, L.P. and
            Orton
            Ceramic Foundation. The controllers add convenience and accuracy to your firings.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            Owning a Sentry is like hiring an assistant to watch your kiln. Nevertheless, please remember that you
            should
            monitor the kiln occasionally during firing, especially near the expected shut-off. (We do not warrant
            against
            over-fires.)

            Most Paragon Ceramic Kilns use the Sentry 12-key. Its exciting features include:

                temperature.

        <p class="text-left">
            The Sentry 2.0 can be installed on ALL existing Paragon 12-key digital kilns. It uses the same size
            faceplate
            as the earlier DTC100-1000 series. Upgrade a switch-operated kiln with the wall-mount version.
        </p>

            <strong class="h4">Thermocouples</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The thermocouple senses temperature inside the kiln. The standard thermocouple on most Paragon kilns
            equipped with the Sentry 2.0 is the ¼” Type-K. It is hermetically sealed in a metal sheath for long life.
            It replaces the earlier 1/8” thermocouple.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though a precision instrument, the thermocouple wears with use, resulting in a gradual shift in temperature
            readout. (This wear occurs mostly above 2000°F.) If you fire pottery, consider the deluxe Type-S, noted for
            its extreme longevity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Ramp-Hold Custom Programming</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Ramp-Hold allows you to infinitely adjust each part of the firing cycle. Vary the firing to obtain different effects from the same glaze.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ramp-Hold programs are made of segments. Each segment has a temperature, firing rate, and, if desired, a firing rate.
