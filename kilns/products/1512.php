                The Vulcan II is the most beautiful glass blower’s kiln Paragon has ever produced. From the easy-access, glistening control panel to the built-in stand to the crucible cover lifting assembly, the kiln is built to far exceed your expectations.
                The Vulcan II heats approximately 50 pounds of glass to molten temperature. Mix custom glass colors. Make huge glass figurines, paper weights, blown vessels, stringers, and much more. Pull your own neon tubing. Make glass castings. The Vulcan II is a glass blower’s dream kiln.

            <p class="card-text">
                The rugged K-25 firebricks are designed for prolonged periods at high temperatures. They are much more suitable for crucible work than the standard K-23 firebricks. The K-25 sidewalls are a massive
                4 ½" thick. The K-25 firebrick bottom, lid, and crucible cover are 3" thick.

                Place the crucible in the kiln on a shelf. Adjust the height of the crucible with posts under the shelf. The crucible hole in the lid is covered by a 12" firebrick cover that lifts out of the way on pivoting support arms so you won't have to find a place to lay the hot crucible cover. It pivots up and out of the way with one-handed operation. Furniture (sold separately): Order the C10-R (10" round x 1/2") shelf and 1 ½" wide posts of the correct length to support your crucibles.

            <p class="card-text">
                The deluxe S-Type platinum thermocouple with ceramic protection tube is now standard on all Vulcan II kilns. This thermocouple far outlasts the standard K-Type. It is also resistant to temperature drift.

                The Vulcan II is not just beautiful to look at it. It is designed from the inside out for consistent performance. The elements are made of Kanthal AMP wire, which lasts longer than the standard Kanthal A1.

            <p class="card-text">
                The bottom section of the Vulcan II includes the firebrick floor and the bottom row of blank 2½" high wall bricks. The bottom section is held in place with heavy duty spring-twist locks. Should a crucible crack and leak glass onto the kiln floor, merely replace the damaged bottom section. The 2½" high wall section is blank, so you won’t worry about damage to a heating element from a cracked crucible. The kiln sections each have two convenient hand lifts (four total).

            <p class="card-text">
                A heavy galvanized steel base completely covers the reversible brick bottom. Tabs around the galvanized base are pushed up under the stainless case on all sides and fastened with screws to strengthen the firing chamber. This is one more assurance that your Paragon kiln is built to last.

                Program the digital controller for the exact consistency of glass melt that you desire. The hinged lid floats to compensate for expansion. You can also fire pottery or glass fusing in the Vulcan II. Comes with a one year warranty and heavy-duty stand. (Please note: Due to the long firing cycles of a crucible kiln, the warranty does not cover the heating elements.)

        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">
                A mercury relay is standard on the Vulcan II. (The relay sends power to the heating elements from the controller.) The Vulcan II has the same mercury relay found on our large industrial kilns. This type of relay far outlasts mechanical relays. The life of the quiet, reliable mercury relay has been measured in millions of on/off cycles.

            <p class="card-text">
                The heavy-duty kiln stand is welded from tubular steel and includes locking casters. The kiln is held in place with twist locks. The control box is finished in a durable high temperature, water-base black paint, which releases low emissions during spraying. This creates a safer working environment for our employees and cuts down on pollution.

                At Paragon, phone calls that are received during business hours are answered by a live person at the factory. They are here to help you long after the sale should you ever need it. And, of course, the glass blower’s Vulcan II furnace is made in America by skilled workers. Many of them have been with Paragon for over a decade.
