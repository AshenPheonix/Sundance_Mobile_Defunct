        <p>&nbsp;This picture is shown with the casting tints fused on top of a piece of white glass. White makes the colors show darker than they may actually appear.</p>

        <p>The intensity of color in the transparent tints increases with the thickness of the object cast. At 3mm (1/8&quot;) thick, it appears virtually clear. At 2 cm (1&quot;) or more, the full color is apparent.</p>

        <p>The hue of &quot;shift colors&quot; change depending on the thickness and or lighting of the casting. The colors shown above are rough approximations of the changes you will see in the actual glass.</p>
        <p>For casting where glass clarity is important, use cullet. For frostier quality in the glass, use frit. The finer the grain, the less transparent the casting. Great for Stained Glass - Glass Fusing<br style="clear:both">Glass Casting - Flame working

            All 3 sized sheet sizes are great! - they survive UPS shipping. The Smaller size one pound sheet is great if you need to add a bit of color without buying a large sheet. One edge has the factory rolled edge. The one pound pieces vary in size a bit and
            common sizes are around 7&quot; x 13&quot; or 9&quot; by 10&quot; or 11-1/2&quot; by 8-1/2&quot; all about a pound of great looking glass. 3mm <b>&quot;Standard&quot;</b> thickness.

<p>These pieces are cut from master factory sheets, therefore:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The size may not be exact!</li>
    <li>One side of each sheet has a bumpy factory rolled edge.</li>
</ul>
