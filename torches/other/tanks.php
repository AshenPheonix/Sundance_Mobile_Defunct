                Usually rented at your local welding shop. Tank size can vary between 20 cubic feet of oxygen to about 300 cubic feet of oxygen. The larger the tank, the cheaper the price is per cubic foot. Prices can vary a lot depending on location and store and are usually negotiable. Shop around. I have seen prices for large tanks under $10 to over $40. We pay $25. Each time you refill, you will pay this fee (tanks are actually exchanged, empty for full, ). There is also a monthly rental fee for each tank, usually between $3 and $5 and oftentimes requiring a deposit, around $100. You can bring the tank to the welding shop for exchange or have the welding shop deliver it to you, for a fee of course. Don't forget to find out what this fee is when you are like residential neighborhoods. Ask them. Also consider how heavy the tank will be if you have to move it yourself or up stairs.
            </p>

                How about buying your tank instead of paying a monthly rental fee? Sure! The "break even" point may be 4 years. Tanks are running around $300 to purchase. But no monthly rental fee. Run the numbers. How long does the tank last? It depends on the torch and is the torch setting high or low. Typically a Minor Burner Torch set at a medium setting will use about 15 cubic feet of oxygen per hour or approx $1 per hour. We have been talking about a compressed gas tank. There is also another type of oxygen available, liquid Oxygen. When Oxygen is couled it turns from a gas into a liquid. You can use a tank of liquid Oxygen. It will last a long time and would cost much less to run your torch. Cost of a 160 liter tank is about $100 to $200. Also a $1.50 to $2 per DAY rental fee. We pay $45 per month. Once again, shop around.

                                    Within hours or a day after the tank not being used, the oxygen leaks, bleeds off, and continues to bleed until you begin to use it again. It is designed to bleed off. Remember the liquid is warming and turning to a gas and it needs to go somewhere. You must use the tank often, almost daily to take advantage of the cheaper price.
