        <div class="h6">$20 Domestic Order Minimum and 1-3 Business Day Processing Period</div>
        <p>
            If your order is less than $20.00 US (product, not shipping), the shopping cart will allow you to finish
            the order but we will cancel the order and refund you. If your order is placed before noon Pacific time we
            try to get your order out that day or by the end of the next business day. Shipping time is 1-7 business
            days depending on your location. We do provide an optional Rush fee of $10.00 to US customers to speed up
            processing and put orders in our express checkout. Please call 888-446-8452 or email us at <a href="mailto:mail/*dead*/glass.com">mail/*dead*/glass.com</a>.
            Adult signature may be required at time of delivery. Thank You.

        <div class="h6 text-capitalize">When will my credit card be charged?</div>
        <p>
            When your credit card is processed by the shopping cart we will put a authorization hold on the total of
            the shopping cart. Once we have accurately calculated your order reflecting any out of stock items, sale
            items, and any shipping charge adjustments we will then capture the amount and if necessary increase or
            decrease the dollar amount to reflect any changes made. If adjustments are made you will be notified of the
            changes. It can take up to 3 business days for the adjustments to reflect on your bank account statement.
            Any Offline orders placed will be charged at the time of shipping.
        </p>
        <div class="h6 text-capitalize">When will my PayPal Account be charged?</div>
        <p>
            Your PayPal Payment will be processed immediately. If your order total is different than what the shopping
            cart displayed, due to any out of stock items, sale items, or different shipping costs, we will send you a
            refund or request additional funds.
        </p>
        <div class="h6 text-capitalize">is my shipping cost accurate?</div>
        <p>
            Shipping charges are based on number of boxes, the weight and size of each box plus the delivery location.
            Shopping carts systems do not accurately calculate all of these conditions prior to packing. Only after
            packaging can we determine your actual shipping cost. We do this to save you money on shipping. Many other
            internet companies overcharge you for shipping rather than take the time to determine your actual shipping
            costs.
        </p>
        <div class="h6 text-capitalize">International Shipping</div>
        <p>
            Our shopping cart can not accurately calculate international shipping.
            A Customer Service Representative will contact you about shipping costs.<br>

            We ship by UPS and Gold State Overnight - They are the best companies for the best price for the service
            they offer.

        <p>
            We will send your order by USPS if you request it but your shipping rate may be more expensive than UPS and
            your order will take longer to process and ship.

            Normal shipping is by UPS.
            Our minimum shipping and handling for anything sent is $7.50.
