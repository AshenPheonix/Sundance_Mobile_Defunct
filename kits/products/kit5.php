            This kit uses the two gas (oxygen and propane) <strong>Minor Bench Burner</strong> by <strong>Nortel,</strong> only <strong class="red">$139</strong> when purchased with this kit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just connect this torch to a BBQ type propane tank (you may have one in your back yard) and to an oxygen tank. Most people rent this oxygen tank at their local welding supply store. It might typically cost $5.00 per month to rent the tank and about $15.00 to $35.00 each time you have it refilled. It costs about $1.00 per hour to run the Minor Burner torch.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're planning to use an Oxygen Concentrator with your kit or upgrade the hose length, you can adjust these items in your shopping cart. If purchasing the Kit #5 with a Minor Burner, Without an Oxygen Regulator be sure to click the appropriate button below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use this kit if you want to start off with a good solid glass bead making setup. You would have all of the same basic tools any professional lamp worker would use to make beads, buttons, or sculptures.
