        <span class="small">&nbsp;The shipping estimate for your order that you are quoted in check out will not reflect the actual <br> 
            shipping total of the kiln - <strong>kilns are drop shipped separately from the manufacturer</strong>, so the shipping totals for all orders that include kilns need to be calculated by our customer service representatives.
        <br>
        <br> You will be contacted by one of our customer service representatives once your order has been processed and your shipping total has been figured. 
        <br>
        <br> If the manufacturer has the kiln you&#39;ve ordered in stock it will be shipped fairly soon. However, <br> please note that <strong> shipping may be delayed 2-5 weeks </strong>if the manufacturer
        <strong>does not</strong> have the kiln <br> in stock. This is especially true during the holiday season and other busy times of the year.</span><br>

<h3 class="white">Do you need a kiln for lampworking?</h3>
<strong><span class="style3">There are two reasons you need a kiln designed for 
  Lampworking:<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong>When you&#39;ve finished working a glass bead in your torch you need to cool it slowly enough to avoid thermal shock and cracking, which is what kilns are used for. However, it is important to note that<br> you may
still have stress in the bead even if you have cooled it without having it crack.
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A glass bead must also be properly annealed. Annealing is done by exposing your bead to a certain temperature for a particular period of time, which only a kiln can do. The bigger your bead,
<br> the more time it will take to anneal; the requisite temperature depends on the type of glass you<br> are using (Moretti is about 940&#176; F) and the length of time depends on the thickest part of
<br> the bead (a typical length might be 15 minutes, but longer doesn&#39;t hurt).
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beads can also be cooled then later put into a cold kiln and brought up to a given temperature for
<br> annealing. Alternatively, annealing can be done immediately by putting a bead, still on the<br> mandrel, into a hot kiln directly from a torch flame. Hot Glass kilns are specially designed so that beads can safely be put into them while they&#39;re
hot.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<span class="style4"> <br>
  <strong>There are four popular methods of cooling glass beads.</strong></span><br>
<br>
<span class="style2"><strong>1. Cooling the bead by slowly removing it from the torch flame.<br>
  </strong><br>
  </span>This method is called flame annealing. Many artists use this method of annealing<br> even if they are using a kiln. This method may protect smaller sized beads from thermal
<br> shock and, if properly done can do some annealing for a bead of any size.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="style2"><strong>2. Placing your beads between two layers of fiber blanket.<br>
  </strong> </span> <span class="style3">(<a href="lgtoolweb.php#anchor769704"><strong>See more about this</strong></a>)</span><br>
<br> This method may protect smaller beads from thermal shock,
<br> but does nothing to anneal your glass bead.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="style2"><strong>3. Bury your bead deep in a hot crock pot filled with hot </strong> </span>
<a href="lgtoolweb.php#vermiculite"><span class="style2"><strong>vermiculite</strong></span></a><strong>. <br>
  </strong> <br> This method also may protect smaller beads from thermal shocking,<br> but also does nothing to anneal your glass bead. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="style2"><strong>4. Place your bead in a heated kiln.</strong></span> <br>
<br> Using a kiln will protect a bead of any size from thermal shock and will anneal your
<br> glass bead if kept at the correct temperature for a sufficient period of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="style2"><strong>How is a Lampworking Kiln different from a Ceramic Kiln?</strong></span><br>
<br> A ceramic kiln could work for bead making, but a lampworking kiln is safer for such
<br> projects for a couple of reasons. Keep in mind that beads are put into kilns while they
<br> are on and at very high temperatures.<br>
<strong><br>
  Electrocution - </strong>If you put a bead, still on the mandrel, into a ceramic kiln and you accidentally<br> touch one of the exposed element wires, you will get electrocuted! Our lampworking kilns will
<br> protect you from electrocution.
<br>
<strong><br>
  Heat</strong> - Yes! When a kiln is used for glass bead making, it is kept at about 1000&#176; F.
<br> If you open a ceramic kiln at 1000&#176;F to put in a bead you risk exposure to very intense
<br> heat. Our Hot Glass kilns have special openings on the sides that allow you to insert your
<br> beads safely. Simply lift up the loose cloth door and place the bead on the rack.
