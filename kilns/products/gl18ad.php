        </h3>
        <p class="alignLeft">
            Create breathtaking glass in the deluxe GL-18AD Professional Series glass kiln. The GL-18AD is proudly made in America by skilled workers and is designed for those whose livelihood depends on glass production.
        </p>
        <br>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">An Endless Variety of Glass Projects</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">Imagine the glass you could sag, slump, and fuse with this kiln. Make small bowls, pendants, earrings, cufflinks, and even bracelets. Enjoy the glittering beauty of dichroics. Make treasured gifts. When you own a Paragon kiln, you
                can experiment with new glass ideas to your heart’s content.<br> Becky Johnson, a glass teacher in Dallas, Texas, describes the excitement of a kiln: &#34;I like to open the kiln with my students so that we can review and admire
                each other’s treasures together. The transformation of the glass inside the kiln is magical and mystical. It changes from pieces of arranged cut glass to awe-inspiring art. To be some part of that process is a true gift.&#34;<br>                        The GL-18AD digital kiln is 13” high inside with room to bend glass for curved windows or cabinet doors and to repair lampshades. Make glass-fused platters. Crack the door to rake or emboss designs in the surface. Make small-to-medium
                sized castings and p&#226;te de verre.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Engineered for Reliabilty</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">Paragon’s GL-series are made for years of rigorous firing, as artists all over America can attest. The insulating firebrick, wrapped in heavy-gauge steel, soak up heat for slow, efficient cooling of the glass. A double heat shield
                and air gap between the kiln and ventilated switch box help keep electrical components cool for long, trouble-free service. Costly heavy-gauge nickel-plated copper wiring is covered with high temperature glass-braided insulation.
                The thermocouple, which senses temperature inside the kiln, is protected with a high-nickel stainless steel sheath for long life.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Dual Mechanical Relays</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">The GL-18AD has dual mechanical relays for extra reliability. They send power to the elements on command from the digital controller. Two relays last longer than the single relay of competitive kilns because of the reduced amperage
                going through each relay.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Optional Deluxe Mercury Relays</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">Relays turn on the kiln’s heating elements. Order your new kiln with the quiet, reliable mercury relay instead of the standard mechanical relays. The life of a mercury relay has been measured in millions of on/off cycles. The mercury
                relay far outlasts the standard mechanical relays and is optional on the GL-18AD.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Pinless Element Grooves</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">The GL-series lid elements use a pinless element groove. Pins are unnecessary because the element coils are wider than the groove opening. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Convenient Loading</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">The spring-pressure door latch and a &#189;&#34; recess around the edge of the firebrick door keep the door tightly closed. The door remains rock-steady on a heavy hinge shaft. Four hand lifts aid moving. The base is open in the back
                and slotted to dissipate heat.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Peepholes</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">Watch the red-hot glass through two tapered peepholes, drilled one above the other in the wall opposite the switch box. Peephole plugs are included. (Most GL-18 models are drilled for peepholes. However, some international models have
                no peepholes. If you are outside the U.S. and you want peepholes, please specify them at the time that you order the kiln.)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Durable Finish</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">The GL-18A has a durable high temperature, water-base finish. We use water-base paint because of the low emissions during spraying. This creates a safer working environment for our employees and cuts down on pollution.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Customer Service</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">At Paragon, phone calls that we receive during business hours are answered by a live person at the factory. We are here to help you long after the sale should you ever need it.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Optional Kiln Stand</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">The heavy-duty GL-series ST8 stand raises your GL-18 kiln to a convenient working height. Begin operating your new kiln without having to find a table strong enough to support over 250 pounds. The table is 147 pounds of rock solid
                construction. The stand is shipped pre-assembled.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 class="alignLeft"><span class="bold red">Optional Ceramic Fiber Top</span></h4>
            <p class="alignLeft">The standard GL-series kiln comes with an insulating firebrick top, grooved for heating elements. The upgrade option is a ceramic fiber top with element grooves. The fiber top helps keep the glass clean during firing.</p><br>
