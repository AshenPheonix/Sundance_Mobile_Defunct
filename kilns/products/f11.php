            Why a Vertical-Drop Door? There is heat on the inside of a kiln door. Kilns with swing out doors expose you to the hot inside
            door. But this Vertical-Drop door swings up never exposing you to that hot door. A digital controller which includes
            a pyrometer is included with kiln. This bead kiln, made with insulated fire brick, can also be used for fusing
            glass, ceramics, copper enameling, or many different uses. All kilns should be kept 12&quot; from any flammable
            materials. The fiber cloth door covering pictured, is included free with the kiln.

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            Anneal large glass figurines in this digital lampworking kiln. Raise the spring-loaded vertical-drop door to insert a glass
            figurine with a punty rod. Lower the door. The punty rod extends outside the firing chamber through the smaller
            punty rod door. This allows the glass to anneal safely.
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
        <p>
            You can make figurines up to 5" tall. Maintain the annealing temperature indefinitely with the Sentry Xpress 3-key controller.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Sentry Xpress 3-key controller is packed with features. It includes two modes: Single Speed and 8-segment Ramp-Hold.

<br> Ease of operation will delight you. Never before has lamp work been so easy in this price range. Imagine the massive, award-winning
figurines you will be able to make with this kiln.
<br>
<br> The F-series lid elements use a new element groove that eliminates element pins. The element coils are wider than the groove
opening, so the elements stay in place without pins. The element is mounted in the top of the kiln for safety. There is no
sidewall element to touch with a punty rod. With the element in the top, you can also fuse and slump glass.
<br>
<br> Imagine the glass you could sag, slump, and fuse with this kiln. Make small bowls, pendants, earrings, cufflinks, and even
bracelets. Enjoy the glittering beauty of Dichroics. This kiln will give you a haven of creative enjoyment that you will
enjoy for many years.
