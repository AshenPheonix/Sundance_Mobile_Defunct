        Lavender has been an all-time favorite home remedy among lampworkers and aroma therapists for minor burns. It can turn a burn into a mild, maybe slightly tender, red spot the next day. This essential oil promotes new cell growth, reduces inflammation,
        stops infection, and decreases pain. In general, stick to treating minor, first-degree burns at home, and leave the care of deeper or more extensive burns to a health care professional.
