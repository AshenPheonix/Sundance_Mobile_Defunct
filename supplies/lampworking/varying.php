        <p>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Tungsten</span> is an amazing metal tolerant of high temperature, which unlike stainless steel, is less likely to melt or burn up in the flame and is less likely to stick to the glass. An ideal metal to manipulate glass by dragging, raking, feathering, or swirling the surface. Can be used to make air bubbles, poke out unwanted air bubbles or poke holes through the glass. Available as a straight sharpened rod or with the end bent for easier raking. This is one of the few tools you can actually put into the torch flame for certain techniques like making holes in glass.

        <h4>Why Use Shorter 60mm Rod</h4>
        <p>
            Your hand is working closer to the tip which gives you more control but then can be uncomfortable working that close to the heat. It depends on which technique you are using the tungsten for.

        <h4>
            Why Use Longer 120mm Rod
        </h4>
        <p>
            Your hand is more comfortable working farther away from the heat but when your hand is farther away you have less control. You would eventually want both lengths in your tool box.

        <h3>Rod Cutter</h3>
        <img src="images/rodcutterlg.jpg" alt="Two Rod Cutters" class="img-fluid">
        <p>
            These vinyl coated rod cutters are great for cutting glass rods, from thin to 1/2" thick. They achieve this by concentrating force in a specific location to break the rod! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Wheel style cutters have round cutting wheels that can be turned as they get dull. The advantage of this over the green handled ones is that it cuts more clean, which doesn't really matter unless you are cutting murrini chips or stringer. A must if you will be cutting murrini chips or stringers as these are least likely to break rods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Green handled cutters are carbide tipped. 7Â½" long. Advantage of this over the wheeled cutter is that it is 'quicker" to use, grab and cut without much aiming between the cutting blades. Please keep in mind these are more susceptible to crushing rods or stringers due to the lack of precision.

        <h4>Cooling your Glass</h4>
        <p>
            There are three ways to help you cool your glass slowing to help prevent thermal shocking or breaking.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="disc">Kiln</li>
            <li class="disc">Crockpot full of hot vermiculite</li>
            <li class="disc">Two Fiber Pads</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To use, place your hot glass between these pads as soon as you are done with it on the torch. The pads hold the heat to slow down the cooling rate. The timing for placing the glass between the fiber is critical. If you place them to soon, when the glass surface is still molten, fibers may stick to the glass. If you wait to long, the glass may cool to much and the risk of breaking is greater. Experiment with the timing. Fiber supplied 2 sizes. Remember only a kiln or flame annealing can anneal glass.
