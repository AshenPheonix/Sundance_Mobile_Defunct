        All 3 sized sheet sizes are great! - they even survive UPS shipping. The smaller size one pound sheet is great
        if you need to add a bit of color without buying a large sheet. One side has the original factory rolled edge.
        The one pound pieces vary in
        size a bit, with common sizes being around 7" x 13" or 9" x 10" or 11-1/2" x 8-1/2." These sheets are 3mm
        "Standard" thickness.<br><br> Notice for Mosaic and Stained Glass Artists The colors shown on this page is the
        color AFTER it is
        heated to a high temperature. Some of the glass below is a completely different color before it's heated <br><br>
        Iridized Glass has a metallic coating giving a beautiful effect on the glass, especially when fused! <br><br>
        Half Thickness THIN
        Glass: 1/2 thickness glass is also available! The dimensions are 8-1/2" x 10" and 1.5mm thick. One side has the
        original factory rolled edge. <br><br> NOTE: The Thin glass has a different product number. Be sure to use this
        number when ordering by phone or you WILL be shipped a standard thickness glass piece. Further Note: all sizes are approximate to &frac18; Inch
