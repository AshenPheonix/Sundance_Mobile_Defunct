    The Micro Scarab is perfect for flameworkers who are starting out or are just working with smaller projects. It runs on common
    household 120V service so you can plug it in just about anywhere. If affordability and portability are important to you,
    this could be your perfect Scarab model.

                programmed a feature in the controller that tells you exactly that amount of time. If you dip below that
                temperature it waits until it is back to set point and restarts the clock.</li>

            Primary Point Rest
        </span>
        <p>The Primary Point rest is designed to slide up and down to support your rods and tubes. If your handles are extremely
            long we would suggest adding the Optional Secondary Point Rest which extends further out from the kiln and is
            fully adjustable up and down.</p>
        <p>When you are ready to anneal you slide the point rest up tight against the doggie door to seal off the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>The point rest is constructed of solid brick and stainless steel for maximum life. To operate them simply loosen
            the the knob, slide the rest to the position desired and tighten the knob. It was specifically designed to be
            a one hand operation so you can hold your glass with the other hand.</p>

            Removable Chassis
        </span>
        <p>
            Letâ€™s face it, these kilns are heavy!. The last thing you want to do is to start wrestling around with them to get at a component
            that needs to be replaced. All Scarab kilns are designed with a
            <span class="bold">Removable Chassis </span> which holds all the main electrical and electronic components. Just remove the screws
            that hold it in place and slide it out. You can even disconnect the power cord and ship the whole thing back
            to Skutt for testing if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most problematic components of kilns has traditionally been the relays. Mechanical relays have a limited life
            which is why Skutt has upgraded all Scarab Kilns with
            <span class="bold">Solid State Relays.</span> These relays or kept cool with a
            <span class="bold">fan mounted in the side</span> of the kiln (not necessary on the Mini Scarab because the Amps are so low).</p>

            Optional Secondary Point Rest
        </span>
        <p>
            The Optional Secondary Point Rests,
            <span class="bold">another unique design of Marcel Braun,</span> are generally ordered on just about every Scarab that goes out.
            Flameworkers love its ability to hold long handles, preventing their work from popping up off the floor. Its
            well thought out design allows you to move the rest to almost any position you want. It not only moves in and
            out but also moves up and down. The scalloped edge ensures that your rods will stay in place.
