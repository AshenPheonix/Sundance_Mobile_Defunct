                <ul class="alignLeft">
                    <li class="disc outside">The software for the COE Controller was developed by Flameworker Marcel Braun to fit the specific needs of the Boro Flameworker.</li>
                    <li class="disc outside">It can be easy as pressing Go to start working and Go twice to anneal your piece and call it a night.</li>
                    <li class="disc outside">The Controller is programmed to heat to 1100 F but you can set it for whatever temperature you want.</li>
                    <li class="disc outside">You can choose between the 3 preset Annealing programs or creat your own.</li>
                    <li class="disc outside">Marcel knows how important it is to know how long your piece is at the set point temperature. That is why he programmed a feature in the controller that tells you exactly that amount of time. If you dip below that temperature it waits
                        until it is back to set point and restarts the clock.</li>
                    <li class="disc outside">It also includes built in striking and repair programs.</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="red bold">Primary Point Rests</span>
                <p class="alignLeft">The Primary Point rests are designed to slide up and down to support your rods and tubes. If your handles are extremely long we would suggest adding the Optional Secondary Point Rest which extends further out from the kiln and is fully
                    adjustable up and down.</p>

                <p class="alignLeft">When you are ready to anneal you slide all 3 point rests up tight against the doggie doors to seal off the chamber.</p>

                <p class="alignLeft">The point rests are constructed of solid brick and stainless steel for maximum life. To operate them simply loosen the the knob, slide the rest to the position desired and tighten the knob. It was specifically designed to be a one hand
                    operation so you can hold your glass with the other hand.</p>

                <img alt="Balanced main door" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="../images/skutt/MainDoorHinge.jpg" class="float_right pad_8">
                <span class="red bold">Balanced Main door</span>
                <p class="alignLeft">The Main Chamber Door hinge system has been completely redesigned with precision hardware for smoother operation. The door is balanced using an counterweight. The arms holding the counter weight were engineered with a precise bend that
                    places the counterweight in a neutral position when the door is half open. This allows for enough weight when the door is down to keep it closed and keeps it from wanting to get away from you when you open it.</p>

                <p class="alignLeft">The entire door is constructed of insulating fire brick surrounded by <span class="bold">heavy gauge stainless steel.</span> The handle is also constructed of stainless steel to prevent corrosion.</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br><img alt="Balanced main door" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="../images/skutt/DoggieDoors.jpg" class="float_left pad_8">
                <span class="red bold">The "Doggie" Doors</span>
                <p class="alignLeft">The Doggie Doors (sometimes referred to as bead doors) are the brainchild of master flameworker Marcel Braun. They are constructed using a channeled <span class="bold">stainless steel</span> frame which holds a section of soft fiberboard.
                    When you close the door it rests gently on your glass handles, sealing in the heat without scratching the glass. If they ever wear out you can replace them easily and inexpensively. The doors are <span class="bold">counterbalanced</span>                    to stay open on their own with weighted wood <span class="bold">handles that stay cool to the touch.</span></p>

                <p class="alignLeft">One of the most valued design elements of the Scarab and Scarab XL kilns is the introduction of the Center Door. The center door allows you to use a single larger diameter tube or rod without affecting the tight seal on the other rods.
                    Without it the larger diameter tube would hold the doggie door up higher, allowing unnecessary heat to escape…Brilliant!</p>

                <img alt="Removable Chassis" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="../images/skutt/chassisopen.jpg" class="float_right pad_8">
                <span class="red bold">Removable Chassis</span>
                <p class="alignLeft">Let’s face it, these kilns are heavy!. The last thing you want to do is to start wrestling around with them to get at a component that needs to be replaced. All Scarab kilns are designed with a <span class="bold">Removable Chassis</span>                    which holds all the main electrical and electronic components. Just remove the screws that hold it in place and slide it out. You can even disconnect the power cord and ship the whole thing back to Skutt for testing if necessary.</p>

                <p class="alignLeft">One of the most problematic components of kilns has traditionally been the relays. Mechanical relays have a limited life which is why Skutt has upgraded all Scarab Kilns with <span class="bold">Solid State Relays.</span> These relays or
                    kept cool with a <span class="bold">fan mounted in the side</span> of the kiln (not necessary on the Mini Scarab because the Amps are so low).</p>

                <img alt="Removable Chassis" class="img-fluid mx-auto" src="../images/skutt/HANDLES.jpg" class="pad_8"><br>
                <span class="red bold">Carry Handles</span>
                <p class="alignLeft">Did we mention these kilns are heavy? Every Scarab kiln is equipped with two pairs of handles so the can be moved easier. The handles are ergonomically placed to balance the weight while you are carrying it and also positioned low enough
                    so you can lift it onto a table.</p>

                <span class="red bold"> Secondary Point Rest</span>
                <p class="alignLeft">The Optional Secondary Point Rests, <span class="bold">another unique design of Marcel Braun</span>, are generally ordered on just about every Scarab that goes out of here. Flameworkers love its ability to hold long handles, preventing
                    their work from popping up off the floor. Its well thought out design allows you to move the rest to almost any position you want. It not only moves in and out but also moves up and down. The scalloped edge ensures that your rods will
                    stay in place.
