            This video covers more ground than its 3 predecessors in the Focus on Flamework series. The most interesting aspect is the demonstration of ways to actually use the different canes in certain pieces as, for example, goblet stems, paperweight figures, or free standing insects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Townsend explains the difference between "filigrana" and "latticino", and how the term "milli's" came to be used instead of "murrini". He also shows examples of master works in the field, and encourages the notion that cane making is accessible to anyone working in glass, clearly demonstrating the necessary techniques for doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this DVD you will learn to make canes with simple external patterns, canes with internal twists, alternating colors in patterns on the outside of a piece, simple star murrini canes, realistic eye canes for amphibians, and you'll learn how to bundle sections of a cane together and draw that down into a complex cane.
        </p>
        <p>
            As before, the combination of interview, demonstration, still images, finished pieces, and now captions and digital animation will make this DVD both useful and easy to understand.
