        <p>
            Paragon's square CS-19 digital glass clamshell kiln is easy to load, because the top lifts out of the way. Load the shelf first and then the glass onto the shelf. Imagine the murals you could make with this kiln.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine the glass murals you could make with this kiln. Fire loads of glass-fused bowls, pendants, earrings, cufflinks, and even bracelets. Try out the newest glass techniques that you've learned from teachers and friends. Enjoy adding glittering dichroic glass to your work of art. Make gifts that your loved ones will enjoy for generations. When you own a Paragon CS-19S, you can experiment with glass fusing to your heart's content. Imagine the freedom to experiment any time you want. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The CS-19S clamshell heats from the top for even heat distribution across the glass surface. The elements are completely embedded in a lightweight ceramic fiber top. The top has no element grooves or pins; this streamlined design helps eliminate dust in the firing chamber. The top of the lid is protected with a painted sheet metal cover. The sheet metal is bent to cover the sides of the lid and then welded at the corners. You will be amazed at the sturdy construction that has made Paragon kilns renowned among glass fusers. The self-adjusting lid floats at fusing temperatures. 
        </p>
        <strong>Kiln Lifts Out of the Way for Easy Loading</strong>
        <p>
            Kiln Lifts Out of the Way for Easy Loading The walls and top, as a single unit, lift up and out of the way so you can assemble glass pieces inside the kiln without hassle. Add stringers and frit to delicate designs, often without using glue. When the kiln shelf is loaded and you are ready to fire, lower the kiln in place. The kiln is easy to open because of three counter-weight springs mounted under the kiln. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This unique feature sets Paragon kilns apart from the competition. The kiln base extends 4" in the back to support the weight of the kiln when in the open position. The base comes with mar-proof rubber feet. The CS-19S clamshell (single opening) top and kiln walls are one unit. If you need the version with a separate lid, please see the CS-19D (double opening). Optional Ceramic Fiber Top The standard CS-16S comes with an insulating firebrick top. You can also upgrade your kiln with the optional deluxe ceramic fiber top, which has the same type of pin less groove as the standard top. The fiber top helps keep the kiln interior even cleaner.
        </p>
        <strong>Optional Glass Window and Bead Door</strong>
        <p>
            Enhance your glass fusing experience with the optional high temperature 1" x 3" glass window. It simplifies fusing by enabling you to watch every stage, from softening, to tack fuse, to full fuse. Watch the glass to fine-tune a digital program. (Always wear firing safety glasses, available from Paragon, while watching the glass through the window.) You can even anneal glass beads with your CS-19S. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Order the optional double 2" x 6 3/8" bead doors, which mount to the front of the kiln. Use your kiln to safely cool large, ornate beads through the annealing range.
        </p>
        <strong>Reliability at the Heart of the Kiln</strong>
        <p>
            You will be amazed at the sturdy construction that has made Paragon kilns renowned. The painted steel case covers the sides and top of the kiln. The CS-19S has a two-year warranty. The temperature sensor, or thermocouple, is sheathed with high-nickel stainless steel for long life. A heavy steel base supports the reversible brick bottom completely. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These features are extra assurance that your Paragon kiln is built to last. No extra stand is needed. The reliable CS-16S has dual mechanical relays for long life. The digital controller sends a signal to the relays to turn on the heating elements. The two relays in the CS-19S last longer than the single relay of competitive kilns because of the reduced amperage going through each relay. In addition, you can order the optional industrial mercury relay for your CS-19S.
        </p>
        <strong>Convenient Features</strong>
        <p>
            For your convenience, flip the switch on the front panel to turn off power to the controller when the kiln is not in use. The large, comfortable wooden lid stays cool. The CS-19S is painted with a durable high temperature, water-base finish. We chose water-base paint because of the low emissions during spraying. This creates a safer working environment for our employees and cuts down on pollution.
