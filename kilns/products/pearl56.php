      <p>Paragon Pearl-56 Glass Fusing Kiln</p>
      <p>The Pearl-56 Professional Series digital glass kiln is an investment that soon pays for itself. Imagine the architectural-scale glass panels that you could make in this kiln. The kiln will help unlock your potential as a glass artist by taking your art to a new level. The kiln is made for those whose livelihood depends on glass production. This is a kiln that you will cherish.</p>
      <p>The Pearl-56 is proudly made in America. The kiln was designed to the scrupulous standards of the Bullseye Resource Center in Portland, Oregon. Master glass artists fired early prototypes and suggested numerous design changes before approving the innovative Pearl-56 version that you will enjoy in your studio.</p>
      <p>The 56” wide, 30” deep, 16 1/2” high clamshell firing chamber splits when the top is up. The lower wall is 4 1/2” high giving convenient access to the shelf area. Heavy-duty air pistons lighten the top. </p>
      <p>The Pearl-56 has two vents in the top and two peepholes/vents along the front. The 2” x 3” front peepholes include firebrick plugs. Watch the glass through every stage of firing. The 2” x 3” top vents come with hinged door covers and high-temperature abrasion-resistant gaskets. The kiln is equipped with casters for hassle-free moving. Level the kiln effortlessly with four leveling feet.</p>
      <p>The efficient Pearl-56 is insulated with a 3” ceramic fiber top and 2 1/2” insulating firebrick walls and bottom. The top presses against a gasket mounted in the lower wall section. A welded 2" tubular steel frame reinforces the kiln for long life. We are so confident in the innovative Pearl-56 that we back it with a two year warranty.</p>
      <p>For unsurpassed heat distribution, elements are mounted in the top, walls, and floor. The top and floor elements use an element groove that eliminates element pins. Because the element coils are wider than the groove opening, the elements stay in place without pins. The sidewall element coils are protected in dropped, recessed grooves. </p>
      <p>
      <p>The Pearl-56 is rich in special features. For instance, mercury relays are standard on this kiln for your peace of mind. Relays send power to the elements on command from the digital controller. Industrial-grade mercury relays found in the Pearl-56 far outlast mechanical relays. The life of the quiet, reliable mercury relay has been measured in millions of on/off cycles.</p>
      <p>To keep the electrical components cool for long, trouble-free service, we mount them away from the firing chamber inside a switch box, which is angled for comfortable operation of the controls. </p>
      <p>The Pearl-56 is ideal for glass casting, because heat comes from the top, four sides, and bottom. For even greater control of the heat, the Pearl-56 uses the digital 12-key Sentry 2.0 controller with advanced power ratio technology. This is a feature pioneered by Paragon to balance the heat between the top and bottom elements in increments of 10%. (i.e., 100% top - 0% sides, 50% top - 50% sides, 80% top – 20% sides, etc.) The split between top and bottom is where the kiln opens, so top and bottom elements each include side elements. Set the heat balance for any combination desired between the top and bottom so that the total heat output equals 100%. Imagine the precise control you will have in adjusting the kiln to slump glass or to improve heat distribution over large fused panels.</p>
      <p>To keep the electrical components cool, they are mounted inside a switch box with a double heat shield and air gap between the kiln and box. Costly heavy-gauge nickel-plated copper wiring is covered with high temperature glass-braided insulation. The thermocouple, which senses temperature inside the kiln, is protected with a high-nickel stainless steel sheath for long 
        life. The Pearl-56 uses the digital 12-key Sentry 2.0 controller. </p>
      <p>You will be amazed at the convenience of digital firing. The reliable solid-state Sentry controller continually monitors the firing so you can spend your time productively without closely watching the kiln. (Please remember, however, to check the kiln during firing and to monitor it near the expected shutoff time.) The sealed touch pad keeps out dust and is easy to wipe clean.
      
      <p>Paragon’s innovative controller will help you achieve consistent results from one firing to the next. The controller has powerful features that you will enjoy using. Yet we have also worked hard to make the controller user-friendly.</p>
      <p>Do you ever wonder how much electricity your kiln uses? The digital controller can figure this for you with the press of a button. Find out how little a kiln actually costs to fire.</p>
      <p>The Pearl-56 has a durable high temperature, water-base finish. We chose water-base paint because of the low emissions during spraying. This creates a safer working environment for our employees and cuts down on pollution.</p>
