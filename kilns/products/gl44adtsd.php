        <h5>Features of the Pargon GL-44ADTSD</h5>
        <strong>Made in America</strong>
        <p>
            The deluxe GL-44ADTSD Professional Series glass kiln will help you to unlock your potential as a glass designer. The kiln
            quickly pays for itself by producing large glass panels, curved windows, lampshades, or production loads
            of glass pendants or glass decals. Experiment with reactive glass colors, screen printing on glass, painting
            with frit and stringers, and glass weaving. The GL-44AD is proudly made in America by skilled workers.
            It is designed for those whose livelihood depends on glass production.
        </p>
        <strong>Industrial-Grade Relays</strong>
        <p>
            The kiln includes features not found on competitive kilns. For instance, mercury relays are standard on this kiln for your
            peace of mind. Relays send power to the elements on command from the digital controller. Mercury relays
            found on the GL-44AD are industrial-grade and far outlast mechanical relays. The life of the quiet, reliable
            mercury relay has been measured in millions of on/off cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interior Dimensions: 22"wide 44" long x 16" deep
        </p>
        <p>
            The 16" depth is ideal for glass sagging. The sidewall heating elements, mounted in all four sides, offer greater control
            of sagging and bending. The kiln uses advanced power ratio technology, pioneered by Paragon, to balance
            the heat between the top and side elements. Program the digital controller to balance the heat between
            the top and sides in increments of 10%. (i.e., 100% top - 0% sides, 50% top - 50% sides, 80% top -20%
            sides, etc.) Set the heat balance for any combination desired between the top and sides so that the total
            heat output equals 100%. Imagine the precise control you will have in adjusting the kiln to slump glass
            or to improve heat distribution over large fused panels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 16" depth is ideal for glass sagging. The robust Sentry 12 key digital controller is standard. The GL-44AD brick bottom
            holds two 20" square shelves. Cover shelves with fiber paper when large projects overlap shelves.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GL-44ADTSD has four peepholes along the front. When ordering the optional Orton KilnVent, be sure to specify whether
            you want peepholes. The kiln comes with welded mounting plates for optional 2" casters.
        </p>
        <strong>Lid Counter-Balance, Pinless Lid Elements</strong>
        <p>
            The lid is easy to lift with Paragon's exclusive LiteLid spring counter-balance. The GL-44AD comes with two LiteLid assemblies.
            (We are the only kiln manufacturer with the patented LiteLid system.) The lid is insulated with 1" ceramic
            fiber and 3" ceramic fiberboard. Replaceable heating elements are mounted in lid fiberboard grooves.
            The groove eliminates element pins since the element coils are wider than the groove opening.
        </p>
        <strong>Reinforced Steel Frame</strong>
        <p>
            2 &frac12;" insulating firebrick lines the walls and bottom. A welded 2" tubular steel frame reinforces the kiln for long
            life. We are so confident in the GL-44AD that we back it with a two year warranty.
        </p>
        <strong>Rigorous Construction</strong>
        <p>
            Paragon's GL-44AD is made for years of rigorous firing. A double heat shield and air gap between the kiln and ventilated
            switch box help keep electrical components cool for long, trouble-free service. Costly heavy-gauge nickel-plated
            copper wiring is covered with high temperature glass-braided insulation. The thermocouple, which senses
            temperature inside the kiln, is protected with a high-nickel stainless steel sheath for long life.
        </p>
        <strong>The Joy of Digital Firing</strong>
        <p>
            You will be amazed at the convenience of digital firing. The reliable solid-state Sentry controller continually monitors
            the firing so you can spend your time productively without closely watching the kiln. (Please remember,
            however, to check the kiln during firing and to monitor it near the expected shutoff time.) The sealed
            touch pad keeps out dust and is easy to wipe clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragon's innovative controller will help you achieve consistent results from one firing to the next. The controller has
            powerful features that you will enjoy using. Yet we have also worked hard to make the controller user-friendly
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you ever wonder how much electricity your kiln uses? The digital controller can figure this for you with the press of
            a button. Find out how little a kiln actually costs to fire.
        </p>
        <strong>Water-Based Paint</strong>
        <p>
            The GL-44AD has a durable high temperature, water-base finish. We chose water-base paint because of the low emissions during
            spraying. This creates a safer working environment for our employees and cuts down on pollution.
        </p>
        <strong>Save on Shipping</strong>
        <p>
            Paragon is centrally located in Mesquite, Texas, along a major shipping route. This reduces shipping costs and delivery time
            to our customers. We pass the reduced shipping costs directly to you. To reduce freight damage, we ship
            the GL-44AD in a custom-built, carrier-approved wooden crate.
