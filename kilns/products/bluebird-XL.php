        <h5>BlueBird XL Features</h5>
        <p>
            The Paragon BlueBird XL has a new and improved ceramic fiber roof, thicker doors with new gaskets, heavier mandrel holders,
            and a stainless steel control panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The BlueBird XL is a dream kiln for the glass bead enthusiast. This 20" wide, 8" deep kiln safely anneals glass to prevent
            breakage during cooling. With your own Paragon annealing kiln, you will never again worry about stress fractures
            in your glass.
        </p>
        <p>
            The kiln opens doorways of opportunity in bead making. The 10" wide double doors give a total of 20" width for inserting
            bead rods. This kiln is ideal for seminar teachers. It is like having two kilns in one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user-friendly 3-key Sentry Xpress digital controller maintains the annealing temperature. Program it for the length of
            time desired. Adjust the cooling rate through the annealing range. The controller is packed with features but
            is so easy to use that your child could program it.
        </p>
        <strong class="red">Improved Ceramic Fiber Top</strong>
        <p>
            The BlueBird XL features new sinusoidal “wavy” elements, which are embedded close to the inner surface of the high-tech,
            vacuum-formed ceramic fiber top. This is an improvement over our earlier embedded coiled elements, because the
            “wavy” elements are mounted closer to the surface. This enables the elements to radiate heat faster for longer
            element life. The ceramic fiber top reduces dust inside the kiln.
        </p>
        <strong class="red">Improved Double Doors with Gaskets</strong>
        <p>
            Both doors are 3½" x 10" and mounted in a 4¼" high opening. The ¾" gap under the doors is filled by flexible, high temperature
            door gaskets, which help to hold in heat. The 2" thick ceramic fiber doors are twice the thickness of our original
            doors. The hinges are continuous across the top for extra longevity.
        </p>
        <strong class="red">Bead Mandrel Holders</strong>
        <p>
            The kiln comes with a single and a double mandrel holder. The single holder supports rods or mandrels from one point; the
            double cradles the rods at two points. The holders are held by magnets. They are sturdy and heavy for stability.
        </p>
        <strong class="red">Rare-Earth Magnets Hold Doors Open or Closed</strong>
        <p>
            Rare-earth magnets hold the doors closed while the kiln is heating to annealing temperature. Phenolic knobs on the door handles
            stay cool to the touch. Use the switch on the front panel to turn off power to the controller when the kiln is
            not in use.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have added a glass rod warmer on top of the kiln. Pre-heating glass rods saves production time.
        </p>
        <strong class="red">Heavy-Duty Construction</strong>
        <p>
            The BlueBird XL has durable 2½" thick insulating firebrick walls and floor. The steel base supports the kiln in two layers.
            The upper steel base supports and strengthens the firebrick floor; the lower steel base covers the entire kiln
            bottom where it rests on your worktable. Electrical components are mounted to the lower base, away from the heat
            of the firing chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sentry Xpress digital controller is mounted under the kiln in an ergonomically sloped panel for easy operation. The design
            saves table space over kilns with a side switch box. The built-in base stays cool even during extended hold times
            for the long life of the electrical system. It is slotted to dissipate heat and comes with mar-proof plastic
            feet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Blue Bird XL plugs into a standard household outlet. The kiln ships by convenient UPS. It ships in a special carton with
            vacuum-formed padding to assure that the kiln will arrive safely.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, of course, the BlueBird XL is made in America to exacting standards. The kiln is coated with durable high-temperature
            water base paint, which produces low emissions during spraying. This is better for our employees and the environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Paragon’s warranty is not affected by frequency of use. Fire your new kiln every day if you want, even in commercial settings.
            That will have no effect on the warranty period.
