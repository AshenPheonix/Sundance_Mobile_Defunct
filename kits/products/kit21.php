            Depending on your country, the HotHead torch may fit directly	on to a propane tank. If not, you will need to use the adaptors included in your kit and connect your torch to a hose coming from your propane or propylene gas tank.
        </p>
        <img src="../../torches/hot_head_torch/images/adaptor-for-hose.jpg" alt="Adaptor Demo" class="img-fluid">
        <p>
        This setup will work regardless of what country you're in. Simply slide on the gas hose and secure with a hose clamp.
        </p>
        <p>
        You would need to get your own C-Clamps to clamp the work surface to your table. C-Clamps are too heavy to ship with your kit.
