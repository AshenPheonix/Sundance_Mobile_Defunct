        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A discussion on the HotHead style torch melting "soft" glass</h4>
        <p>
            A flame needs oxygen and fuel gas like propane or propylene to burn. Molten glass likes a "neutral flame". A "neutral flame" has the proper ratio or amount of oxygen and propane so all of the gasses are consumed in the flame and there is no extra or leftover unburned oxygen or propane. A flame with unburned oxygen is called an "oxidized flame" and a flame with unburned propane is called a "reduction flame". A flame with just the right amount of oxygen and propane is called a "neutral flame".

            If soft molten glass (like Moretti/Effetre) is sitting in a "reduction flame' the colors turn muddy. Even the clear will turn streaky black and muddy. The common torch you might find in your garage just won't work. The reason is, this style torch has plenty of fuel gas from the propane tank but can only get its oxygen from the air. But air has only about 20% oxygen. Not nearly enough to achieve a neutral flame in a torch like this. These torches are made for plumbing or whatever and a neutral flame is not a concern for them. UNLESS you use a torch especially designed for glass, like the HotHead, that pulls in more air therefore more oxygen. It is actually a specially designed torch for glass. Also the extra oxygen makes it a hotter flame.

            Even in the HotHead torch, where you hold the glass in the flame makes a difference. Too close to the nozzle where there is more unburned propane turns the glass muddy, too far out in the flame is not hot enough. You need to learn where the "sweet spot" is in the flame. Also size of flame makes a difference. The bigger the flame the more BTU's and faster you can work the glass. Most common garage brazing torches have a smaller sized flame (compared to the HotHead Torch) which means less BTU's and less heat. The HotHead Torch has as big a flame as you get with this style torch, and guess what, it barely has enough heat. This is why the choice of brand of soft glass makes a big difference. There are some brands like Bullseye Glass that takes twice as long to heat and work than the commonly used Moretti/Effetre Glass. There are even easier to melt glass out here in the world like some Japanese made glass (although very pricey!). Don't even try borosilicate glass (Pyrex), it wont melt at all.

            But can you make great beads with this HotHead torch! YES you can. We had an employee, Calvin Orr, who made the most amazing beautiful beads using only the HotHead torch. He has gone on now to become a fairly famous glass bead maker.

            If you want a torch that has a very hot flame, totally adjustable to achieve a neutral flame, and yes (because it has plenty of heat) it is desirable to have a smaller pointed flame (as compared to the HotHead) so you can heat just a spot on the glass surface to do detail work without heating the whole bead, pendant, button whatever, then you need to use a torch which not only has the propane tank (like the HotHead torch) but also an oxygen tank. By using this pure oxygen you get a very hot flame! Remember hot flame allows you to work faster. You also have two sets of valves which control just the right amount of gasses to get that neutral flame. But of course the down side is the cost. <strong>The Hothead is $39 and this other type of torch costs 10 times more</strong> (because of the hose and regulators you would need), or even more.
