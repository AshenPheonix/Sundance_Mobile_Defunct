                <p>
                    When you place your order, the cusomer service rep does NOT always immediately know if we
                    have all items in stock. Normally, they would send your order to the shipping department
                    where they will process your order and then determine what is and is not in stock. You are
                    welcome to ask us to check and call you back. We are well stocked, but there is always an
                    occasional item we are out of.

                        We will call you if an item is Out of Stock. if you do not respond promptly, we will ship

                    <li class="disc">
                        We DO hold up your order if we deem that item to be a primary and essential item in your

                    <li class="disc">
                        We normally DO NOT backorder out of stock items. You will need to tell us you still need
                        the item by reordering the item at a later time as a new order. If an item is marked <em>o/s</em>
                        on
                        your invoice and you still want it, you will need to call and reorder it. For some items we
                        will back order the item. If an item is marked <em>b/o</em> on your invoice, we have record
                        of it and will send you the item as soon as it comes in.

                        still want. If you request items to be backordered, it is considered a new order and you
                        will need to pay the shipping.

                additional $10 fee which will put you ahead of non-rush orders. 3rd, 2nd, or Next day also have a level
                of priority over all orders. Sometimes we have large orders that take extra time to pull, wrap and box
                up for shipping. Sometimes we may hold up and order if we know an item you needed is arriving soon.
