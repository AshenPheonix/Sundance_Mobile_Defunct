            A easy release mandrel release. (For a medium release, use our Our Blue Coat release. (This Black Coat has graphite in it to help more easily release the bead off the mandrel after the  the bead is cooled.)

            Dries with a smooth finish.  It has the right viscosity to coat a mandrel evenly with one dip, yet with enough cover to hold a large bead securely while being manipulated, even combed. Releases the finished bead cleanly and without fuss.

            For a thicker coating, dip then remove SLOWLY out of the bottle. (Opposite of what one would think).
            For a thinner coating, remove quickly.

            10 and 50 pound containers are not pre thinned with water. Add water and mix to the viscosity you desire. You actually get more for your $ by not buying water.
