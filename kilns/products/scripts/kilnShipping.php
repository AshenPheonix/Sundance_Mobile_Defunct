                    The shipping estimate for your order that you are quoted in the check out will <strong>NOT</strong> reflect the actual shipping total of the kiln - <strong class="red">Kilns are often drop shipped from the manufacturer</strong>. Because of this, shipping totals for all orders that include kilns need to be calculated by one of our customer service representaties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you order your kiln, you will be contacted by one of our customer service representatives after your order, your kiln, and the shipping total has be figured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, <strong>your kiln may be delayed 2-5 weeks</strong> if the manufacturer <strong>does not</strong> have the kiln in stock. This is particularly true during the holiday season and other busy periods.
